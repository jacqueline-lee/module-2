For Module 2, I did not write a new object biography because I was only modifying the data from my scan of the Mayfair Theatre. Thus, no new historical items were mixed into my artifact for Module 2. The object biography for my Module 2 project remains the same as that of Module 1, which can be found [here](https://github.com/jacqueline-lee/hist3812-example-repo-for-artifact/tree/master/object-biography).
