For this module I sonified two sections of the data from the .obj file created for my Mayfair Theatre 3D model.  

[Segment 1](https://my.scorecloud.com/song/b06826869bcb16c0ffe20e1196a5fae2/Mayfair-Theatre-Segment-1-mid)  
[Segment 2](https://my.scorecloud.com/song/3af35587ac6012292b5e044dd81166d4/Mayfair-Theatre-Segment-2)  

These links are to what I considered the "finished" product, but it underwent subjective manipulation based on what I thought would sound more pleasing to hear. I have also uploaded the original midi files to this folder for comparison.
