This was super helpful for splitting the data from my obj file. I didn't use the delimiter as they suggested because all of my data points were of a similar size so I just used the Fixed Width option instead

It's interesting that you bring up those examples! But both of them involve covers that were done well and have been popular. Do artists feel similarly about covers that are highly artistic and creative but do not turn out to be a commercial success?

## jacqueline.lee, 2/14/2018 2:20:57 PM

Reminds me of the song 'Respect' - most of us know it as the signature song of Aretha Franklin but it's actually a heavily reworked cover of an Otis Redding song. If you didn't know Aretha's version was a cover, it'd be difficult to discern they're actually the same song.

### twitter

This sentence reminded me of a [Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/kyalbr/status/963006419141308417) I came across recently. I've also added a page note to the thread itself.

### colonialism

Museums in Western civilizations like to display artifacts from other civilizations as evidence they're cultured and refined, but somehow don't recognize the civilizations themselves for what they are. By moving these artifacts into the sterilized environment of the museum, with space between each item and a handy identifying tag, it objectifies a culture without requiring the viewer to actually engage with the context of the artifacts.

## jacqueline.lee, 2/14/2018 1:42:11 PM

There's always that old joke that the British Museum houses thousands of artifacts, a few dozen of which even belong to them...

But more seriously, bringing an artifact into a museum context is already alienating it from the purpose for which it was originally created for. While I whole-heartedly agree that the Elgin Marbles should be returned to Athens, how much does returning an artifact to a museum in its home country do to restore the context it belongs in?

Is the medieval workshop analogy appropriate because the tools being used are "basic" or is it appropriate because we don't necessarily have any idea what we're doing?

What makes a tool basic? Is it necessary for us to always use "cutting edge" technology if the "basic" version does the same thing?

## jacqueline.lee, 2/14/2018 1:21:15 PM

It's a perspective I've considered before and something like this was discussed a bit in my History of the Future class last semester.

In the context of that class, we were talking about the way science fiction developed but it applies to conservation too. In science fiction, the types of technological advancements that are incorporated into the "future" that's presented is a reflection of what we see in our present today. 

In the context of archaeology and conservation, it's easy to think we're talking about the past, because what needs conservation work is things from the past. But when we choose to preserve items from the past, we are projecting present day values on it. We don't preserve items based on their value or worth when they were being used, we preserve based on their value or worth in today's society. When Pompeii was discovered, people only cared about statuary and it led to situations like the courtyard Professor Graham was trying to digitally restore that he showed us in class. However, today we think the entire place is valuable and are choosing to preserve more than just statues.

I thought of this Twitter thread when doing today's reading (Sam Jacob article), particularly when I got to this quote: "The power of owning objects, of displaying them, is the power over cultural narrative, the narrative of "the victors" as Churchill put it."

### software, spyware, smart homes

Article that I came across on Facebook about what "smart" homes look like now. It reminded me of when Professor Graham said in class that so much of our data from our devices is being sent somewhere to create profiles of us. Kashmir makes a point at the end that her smart devices could lose capabilities through automatic software updates.

## jacqueline.lee, 2/7/2018 1:55:31 PM

This definitely applies to the emphasis we have when studying history from a Eurocentric perspective on written history. I know a lot of people who criticize and think of other forms of history such as oral history as "lesser" and more unreliable but don't stop to think how the writer of a primary source document may also be influenced by external forces to present an event in a certain light.

## jacqueline.lee, 2/7/2018 1:36:44 PM

### recording, live, livestream, live recordings

This article makes a hard distinction between a recording and a live performance, so I'm curious how Gunkel considers "live" recordings and livestreamed concerts/events that later release the recorded version of the event.

## jacqueline.lee, 2/7/2018 4:22:08 AM

### music

I think knowing music is coming via ads and other promotions might increase expectations? You can't anticipate illegal/unauthorized music because the musicians won't shout about it the way "legitimate" music is advertised at you. It's possible people expected something as good as, or even better, than the original "illegal" version and were disappointed.

### music, remix

I started thinking about this album again Monday after class because I am super fond of it, but also the performative aspect that plays heavily into the experience of Spin Cycle, which is what this album is called. 

It's relevant because of the way it's put together. The Afiara Quartet approached Canadian composers and had them compose pieces for them. Skratch Bastid then took the recorded versions of those pieces and remixed them. They then sent the remixed versions back to the original composers, who then wrote a response to the remix for the Afiara Quartet to play with the remixed version. Every time they perform it it's a little bit different because Skratch Bastid mixes it live and thus it sounds different every time. It's definitely an interesting way to look at music, especially classical music. I think a lot of people have this idea of classical music being very stoic and unapproachable, but I find Spin Cycle is very open and easier to digest because it's very clearly a dialogue between the very classical form of the quartet speaking to the very modern concept of scratch DJ and remixing.

If anyone is interested, the pieces they play in the video are:
2 Pop Songs on Antique Poems: No. 2, I Will Not Let You Go, composed by Dinuk Wijeratne
Soul Searching, Pts. 1 & 2 (Skratch Bastid remix)
Through the Invisible, composed by Dinuk Wijeratne [this is the piece Wijeratne composed in response to the remix]

I have a physical copy of the album, and it's also on Spotify if that's an app you use.

### translation

There are a lot of issues in language to language translation when it comes to direct translations vs translations that get to the intended meaning of something but doesn't necessarily reflect the actual words being used. I imagine there are similar issues when it comes to translating the physical into the digital. Just because something looks identical to the original doesn't mean it necessarily conveys the meaning or intent behind the original.

## jacqueline.lee, 1/23/2018 5:09:43 PM

Community involvement is definitely important, but when it comes to focus groups I have a lot of questions. When are these focus groups held, and what kind of people are able to attend these focus groups? Do they only hold one or do they hold a few to increase the diversity of people able to attend?

## jacqueline.lee, 1/23/2018 5:00:19 PM

### confused

I don't understand how examining "opportunities and implications of digital visualisation technologies for community engagement and research" goes beyond inclusion. Surely by engaging the community, you're practising inclusion?

## jacqueline.lee, 1/23/2018 4:54:30 PM

### professionalization, industry standards

Professionalization in the past was largely to create uniform standards across a given industry for process and documentation, but with the internet now as long as we state what the standards are anyone with internet access can adhere to them.

I don't think there's a way for me to like your comment but this is the best reaction to an academic reading I've ever seen in my entire life.

## jacqueline.lee, 1/12/2018 10:30:12 PM

### privilege, academia, ivory tower

Personally I hope digital humanities can move away from formal academia - while there's definitely value in learning and creating within the structure of a university, it creates this sense that things created in a university are inherently "better" than something created by a smart person who didn't have the opportunity to attend "higher" education.

## jacqueline.lee, 1/12/2018 10:26:13 PM

### touchingstuff

Something your comment made me consider: what kind of information do we miss out on when we don't get to experience the physicality of an artefact? Digitizing books and other historical objects is really awesome for opening up access and in some ways removing some of the hierarchical nature of academia, but what do we lose by not getting to see something with our own eyes or touching it with our hands? 

## jacqueline.lee, 1/12/2018 10:21:23 PM

### SEO, mobile users

I once went to a search engine optimization session led by Google and one of the things they emphasized was optimizing websites for mobile users. If your site isn't optimized for mobile, people are much more likely to try another site for the same thing. Conversely, mobile users were much more likely to make impulse purchases on a mobile optimized site. 

For me this quote is about fixing the flaws with the way information is delivered to us so we don't have to stop tinkering with the delivery system and get down into the nitty gritty of the information we're getting. 

## jacqueline.lee, 1/12/2018 9:27:31 PM

### machines, industrialization, handmade, value

By not requiring someone to engage with the material they're using to create with, Morris is arguing this devalues the end product. A lot more thought and consideration is put into say, a handmade textile versus something made on a mechanized loom. While a lot of consideration might be put into the initial design, once the thread hits the loom there's no thought or consideration being put into the work. It's why people still pay to see live concerts instead of being content to just sit at home listening to a recording. The act of creation is what gives something value. The disposable culture we live in today is fed by the fact we don't value machine made materials the same way we cherish the handmade.

The image of the actor in the camera or of yourself in the mirror is a replication of yourself in the world. It's representative of yourself but isn't you.

Depictions/reproductions in this manner are creating representations of the original work, rather than purporting to be the original

## jacqueline.lee, 1/7/2018 12:13:22 PM

The fact art is available to all rather than the rich means it's interpreted from more diverse perspectives - broadens the knowledge that can be acquired without leaving home

## jacqueline.lee, 1/6/2018 6:24:13 AM

Advent of printing press and other ways of rapidly reproducing art + text meant art became more accessible to people who were not the elite/rich

### worrying, procrastination, exciting!

I'm super excited for this class because it sounds really interesting but I'm also really concerned because I describe myself as "an aggressive procrastinator" and it's bitten me in behind quite a lot, especially this past fall semester, and it looks like the schedule for work for this class is pretty tight. Nevertheless, I'm excited to start on Monday!

From the annotations that are here so far at least I'm not the only procrastinator in the class...
